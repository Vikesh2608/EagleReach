# EagleReach
“AI-powered civic engagement assistant using Kiro – built for the U.S. government and its citizens.”
---

## 🧠 Inspiration
As an F1-OPT student working at Jabil and inspired by civic engagement, I wanted to build a project that empowers citizens and government agencies to interact better through AI.

## 💡 What it does
EagleReach is an AI-powered civic engagement assistant that:
- Answers civic-related questions using natural language.
- Helps users find local representatives, file reports, or access services.
- Provides government agencies with insights from citizen queries.

## 🛠️ How we built it
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI/LLM Integration**: Kiro SDK
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: GitHub Codespaces + Docker + Vercel (or AWS)

## 🧗 Challenges we ran into
- Setting up Kiro’s steering and hooks correctly.
- Ensuring prompt injection protection.
- Deploying a scalable backend under free-tier limits.

## 🎯 Accomplishments we're proud of
- Real-time civic assistant deployed to a live demo.
- Successfully used Kiro’s steering API.
- Aligned project goals with real-world civic use cases.

## 📚 What we learned
- Prompt engineering using Kiro.
- Clean separation of frontend and backend with CI/CD.
- Open-source best practices and Markdown documentation.

## 🚀 What's next for EagleReach
- Add voice interface for accessibility.
- Integrate Open Data APIs from U.S. Gov.
- Partner with local municipalities for pilot testing.
